# @xunnamius/babel-preset-next-babel

This is a custom port of Next.js's [`next/babel`][1] package with support for
the latest features of Babel and TypeScript. Specifically, this package is an
attempt to fix the lack of support for `satisfies` (see
[vercel/next.js#43799][2]).

Thanks to [@valentinpalkovic from Storybook][3] for getting pointing me in the
right direction on where the problems are.

Best case scenario: Vercel has not completely abandoned Babel in favor of SWC
(Babel is still much more popular as of 2023!) and `next/babel` will be updated
in the near future effectively obsoleting this package.
